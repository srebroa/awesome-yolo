## Performance Metrics

### Accuracy (A)  
**A** = (Number of Correct Predictions) / (Total Number of Predictions)  

Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the algorithm's predictions.

### Precision (P)  
**P** = (True Positives) / (True Positives + False Positives)  

It quantifies the algorithm's ability not to label false positives. It measures the fraction of correctly predicted positive instances among all predicted positive instances.

### Recall (R)
**R** = (True Positives) / (True Positives + False Negatives)  

It quantifies the algorithm's ability to find all positive instances.

### F1 Score (F1)
**F1** = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)  

The F1 score provides a balanced measure of the algorithm's performance, as it is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

### Average Precision (AP)
**AP** = ∑(P<sub>i</sub> × ΔR<sub>i</sub>)  

- **P<sub>i</sub>** is the precision value at the *i*-th recall point.  
- **ΔR<sub>i</sub>** is the change in recall from the *i*-th to the (*i*+1)-th recall point.  

AP summarizes the performance of an algorithm across different confidence thresholds. It quantifies the precision-recall trade-off for a given class.

### Mean Average Precision (mAP)
**mAP** = (AP<sub>1</sub> + AP<sub>2</sub> + ... + AP<sub>n</sub>) / *n*  

- **AP<sub>1</sub>, AP<sub>2</sub>, ..., AP<sub>n</sub>** are the Average Precision values for each class.  
- *n* is the total number of classes.

### Intersection over Union (IoU)
**IoU** = (Area of Intersection) / (Area of Union)  

It is used to determine the accuracy of localization, measuring the overlap between predicted bounding boxes and ground truth bounding boxes.

### Inference Time
Time taken to make predictions on a single input image. It measures the time it takes for the algorithm to process the input and produce the output (bounding boxes, class predictions) without considering any external factors.

### Processing Speed (FPS)
Time taken by the algorithm to process a given dataset or a single image.  

Often represented as **FPS** (Frames Per Second), which indicates the number of frames (or images) that the algorithm can process per second.  

It takes into account factors such as data loading, pre-processing, and post-processing steps in addition to the inference time.

### Number of Parameters
The number of model parameters indicates the model's complexity and memory requirements.

### Memory Usage
It measures the amount of memory consumed by the algorithm during inference.
